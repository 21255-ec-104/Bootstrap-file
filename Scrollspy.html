   <h1> Scrollspy</h1>
Automatically update Bootstrap navigation or list group components based on scroll position to indicate which link is currently active in the viewport.<br>
<h1>How it works</h1>
<h4>Scrollspy has a few requirements to function properly:</h4>

If you’re building our JavaScript from source, it requires util.js.
It must be used on a Bootstrap nav component or list group.
Scrollspy requires position: relative; on the element you’re spying on, usually the <body>.<br>
When spying on elements other than the <body>, be sure to have a height set and overflow-y: scroll; applied.<br>
Anchors (<a>) are required and must point to an element with that id.
When successfully implemented, your nav or list group will update accordingly, moving the .active class from one item to the next based on their associated targets.<br>
