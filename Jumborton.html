    Jumbotron in Bootstrap:
<br>
A "jumbotron" is a prominent container element in Bootstrap that is often used to display key information, messages, or calls to action. It's a large and noticeable area that can be used at the top of a webpage or in other sections where you want to draw attention. The jumbotron is styled with extra padding, a background color, and a larger font size to make its content stand out.
<br>
<br>
In this example, the jumbotron class is applied to a <div> element, and various other Bootstrap utility classes like display-4, lead, my-4, and btn are used to style the content within the jumbotron.
